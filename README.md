# Experimental Data for "Nonholonomic Dynamic Movement Primitives"

## Description

This repository contains the experimental data related to the article "Nonholonomic Dynamic Movement Primitives." The data provided here support the findings and analyses presented in the paper. Specifically, this repository includes:

- A large dataset from the numerical validation, where each set of trajectories contains 1000 random demonstrations along with their generalizations to random goals, as explained in the article.
- Data from experiments conducted on the robot.

All datasets have been converted to `.mat` format for ease of use. Due to the large size of the numerical validation dataset, the `.zip` files are divided into multiple parts, which need to be reconstructed into a single `.mat` file.

## Data Description

- **Numerical Validation Data**: Contains multiple sets of random trajectory demonstrations and their respective generalizations.
- **Robot Experiment Data**: Includes data collected from real-world robotic experiments.
- **File Format**: All data are stored in `.mat` format for convenient access in MATLAB or other compatible software.
